# Agent Instructions

- Use two spaces for indentation and terminate statements with semicolons.
- Favor `const` over `let` when variables are not reassigned.
- Use `browser` WebExtension APIs; fall back to `chrome` for compatibility.
- Run `npm test` before committing to ensure `web-ext lint` passes.
